Attention: for Windows users, replace `gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`

## How to Use ##
1. Set up EC2 instance and pull from master
2. Update instances to Java 9 if required
3. Create a "Server.txt" file in the project root with Public DNS addresses of each EC2 instance
4. Run the following command to build and deploy:
    ```
     > ./gradlew bootstrapAws -Ppem=/Users/kierse/.ssh/eece513_aws.pem
    ```
5. In any EC2 instance home directory, start a cluster node:
```
> java -jar distributed-app-1.0.jar
```
6. On startup, the node will print out its join address. This address can be used by other nodes wishing to join its cluster:
````
> java -jar distributed-app-1.0.jar 127.0.0.1
````
Note: starting a node without the address of an existing cluster will effectively create a second cluster.

## To grep node logs ##
7. Follow instructions found [here](https://bitbucket.org/eece513/distributed-grep) and install distributed-grep on each EC2 instance.<br />
Note: will need to be running code 'Assignment02' tag or later
